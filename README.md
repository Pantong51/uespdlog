# uespdlog
spdlog in ue4

This is a work in progress. 

My goals for this plugin is to allow shipping logging with a -spdlog in the launch commands.
My reasons for this plugin are
* #1 Learn more about ue4's plugin and build systems
* #2 Build a logging tool that wil allow logging in shipping builds without sacrificing speed
