# uespdlog
spdlog in ue4

This is a work in progress. 

My goals for this plugin is to allow shipping logging with a -spdlog in the launch commands.
My reasons for this plugin are
* Learn more about ue4's plugin and build systems
* Build a logging tool that will allow logging in shipping builds without sacrificing speed

If you want to use this plugin, go for it. Just follow the spdlog's license agreement, whatever that is
